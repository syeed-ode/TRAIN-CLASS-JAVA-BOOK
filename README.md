# TRAIN-CLASS-JAVA-BOOK
During this training session you will need a few things. 

First and foremost you will need the JDK (Java Development Kit). This is different from a JRE (Java Runtime Enviornment). The JDK has more power: it enables you to actually perform development tasks. The JRE only lets you run Java applications.

Second you will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The IDE we will be using in IntelliJ, made by JetBrains. JetBrains is my favorite. They produce IDE's for a lot of languages. All of them that I've used have been...TIGHT! Yeah. I've found them to be like that sexy prom date smiling at the pickup location for all of the memorable pics!

Anyway, there are other IDE's: Spring uses an Eclipse based IDE, Spring Tool Suite. It's pretty nice, too. I mean if your first prom choice has already been selected. Eh, have a great time with the second! (Don't tell Dave Syr I said this. He's like the prom king of the Spring world and I don't want to end up in the parking lot.)

The point is you can't run an IDE without at least the JRE. And you can't develop without the JDK. So, first, download the JDK.

# Let's, install a JDK

I've provided 3 versions of a JDK. Two are for Winows. One is for MAC. If you need a linux version, type this into www.google.com: "download java jdk for linux OS"

	a) If you don't know which Windows version you have do the following

		1) hit: "open windows + R"

		2) type in "msinfo32", hit "ENTER"

		3) take a look at the "System Info" it will tell you wheter you are x64bit or something else
	
			a) download  "jdk-8u181-windows-x64.exe" if you have x64bit
	
			b) download  "jdk-8u181-windows-i586.exe" if you have something else

	b) If you have a MAC it's easy

		1) download  "jdk-8u181-macosx-x64.dmg"


# Now, let's go to the prom....Download our IDE
